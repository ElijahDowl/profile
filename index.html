      <h1 id= "Academics"> Academics</h1>
      <p> I am a high school student at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx. I am in the 9th Grade.</p>
      <h3> 9th Grade Science: Biology</h3>
      <p>This year has been a bit hard for me in science as Biology is not my thing. I found a tutor and it has been going well. <p>
      <h3>9th Grade Math: Intermidiate Geometry</h3>
      <p>Geometry is a little on and off for me. There have been subjects I have been doing well on, and others I struggled with. </p>
      <h3>9th Grade History: Modern World History</h3>
      <p>History has been a pretty good class for me this year. I have been passing with good grades on all of my assignments.</p>
      <h3>9th Grade English: English III</h3>
      <p>English, like history, has been a good class this year. They essays and books we are reading are all interesting this year so that helps a lot.</p>
      <h3>9th Grade Latin: Latin III</h3>
      <p>Latin has been a bit of a confusing class this year. I'm doing well in the class, but it isn't easy in the slightest. I was behind from middle school so catching up while learning new information was hard for me, but I'm keeping up.</p>

      <h1 id= "Athletics"> Athletics </h1>
      <h3> Water Polo </h3>
      <p>  I play Water Polo for my school, though we aren't very good at all and we didn't win any games. I have high hopes for next year as the new players have already had some playing time. I play as cap number 15. </p>
      <p> Goals: To win a game with my team next year
      <h3> Swimming </h3>
      <p>I currently swim for my school's swim team, The Feildston Eagles. I have been swimming since i was four and it has been a major part of my life since then. I have swam on many teams outside of school such as the Lehman College Apex and the Westchester Wolverines, before deciding to quit and swim in school due to time restraints. I hope to run for team captain within the next 2 years. </p>
      <p>Best Events: 50m Freestyle and 100m Breaststroke.</p>
      <h3> Best Times </h3>
      <p>50m Freestyle: 24.70</p>
      <p>100m Breaststroke: 1:13.21</p>
      <p>100m Freestyle: 1:02.73</p>
      <p>Goals: To break at least one of my school's records (50 freestyle) and to become team captain in my Junior year of High School. 
      <h3> Track </h3>
      <p> To be Announced </p>
