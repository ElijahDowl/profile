      <h3> Water Polo </h3>
      <p>  I play Water Polo for my school, though we aren't very good at all and we didn't win any games. I have high hopes for next year as the new players have already had some playing time. I play as cap number 15. </p>
      <p> Goals: To win a game with my team next year
      <h3> Swimming </h3>
      <p>I currently swim for my school's swim team, The Feildston Eagles. I have been swimming since i was four and it has been a major part of my life since then. I have swam on many teams outside of school such as the Lehman College Apex and the Westchester Wolverines, before deciding to quit and swim in school due to time restraints. I hope to run for team captain within the next 2 years. </p>
      <p>Best Events: 100m Breastroke and 50m Freestyle.</p>
      <h3> Best Times </h3>
      <p>50m Freestyle: 25.69</p>
      <p>100m Breastroke: 1:16</p>
      <p>100m Freestyle: 1:02</p>
      <p>Goals: To break at least one of my school's records and to become team captain in my Junior year. 
      <h3> Track </h3>
      <p> To be Announced </p>
